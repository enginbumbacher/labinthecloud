Keep that in mind when creating the eye position and orientation.\nThe y axis is pointing down, the z axis is pointing right.\n1. sensorPosition is defined as an index of a 2-dimensional matrix of possible positions. Each of these positions get translated to a set of coordinates in space.\nThe position is defined with respect to the body. (-1,-1) is the top most left point. (1,-1) is the top most right point. (1,1) is the bottom most right point.\n2. sensorOrientation is the orientation of the sensor in the body. 0 corresponds to (0,1,0), Math.PI/2 to (1,0,0), Math.PI to (0,-1,0), etc.\n3. sensorField is the visual field of the sensor. Math.PI corresponds to a 180 deg visual field, around the sensor orientation  Currently, there will be only two values: Math.PI and 2*Math.PI\n4. spotPositions is defined the same way as sensorPosition, but as an array of all spots.\n\nA spot influences the sensorField of an sensor. It either halves it if the sensorField is 2*Math.PI, or it basically sets it to zero, if it is positioned in direction of the sensor orientation.\nAn empty array within a configuration definition means that that corresponding object does not exist.\n*/\nconst defaultConfigs = { // Images are drawn with front to the left, i.e. positive z axis\nsensorConfig_1: { id:'1Sensor_BackLeft', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y:-1},\n    sensorOrientation: Math.PI,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_2: { id:'1Sensor_BackRight', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y:1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_3: { id:'1Sensor_FrontLeft', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y:-1},\n    sensorOrientation: Math.PI,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_4: { id:'1Sensor_FrontRight', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y:1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_5: { id:'1OmniSensor_BackLeft', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y:-1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_6: { id:'1OmniSensor_BackRight', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y:1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_7: { id:'1OmniSensor_FrontLeft', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y:-1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_8: { id:'1OmniSensor_FrontRight', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y:1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_9: { id:'1OmniSensor_FrontCenter', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y: 0},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_10: { id:'1OmniSensor_FrontCenter_Shield_Left', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y: 0},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [{z:1, y:-1}],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_11: { id:'1OmniSensor_FrontCenter_Shield_Right', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y: 0},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: 2*Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [{z:1, y:1}],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_12: { id:'2Sensors_Back', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y: -1},\n    sensorOrientation: Math.PI,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  sensor_2: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:-1, y: 1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}, sensorConfig_13: { id:'2Sensors_Front', config: {\n  sensor_1: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y: -1},\n    sensorOrientation: Math.PI,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  sensor_2: {\n    sensorPosition: {z:1, y: 1},\n    sensorOrientation: 0,\n    sensorField: Math.PI\n  },\n  spotPositions: [],\n  motorConnection: true }\n}}\n\nexport default defaultConfigs\n","import BaseField from 'core/component/form/field/field';\nimport Model from './model';\nimport View from './view';\nimport Utils from 'core/util/utils';\n\nclass SymSelectField extends BaseField {\n  constructor(settings = {}) {\n    settings.viewClass = settings.viewClass || View;\n    settings.modelClass = settings.modelClass || Model;\n    super(settings);\n\n    Utils.bindMethods(this, ['_onVariationChange'])\n    this.checked = false;\n\n    let proportion = (this._model.get('value').split('_').length === 2) ?
